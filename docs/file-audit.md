# CI repository file audit

Audited on 2026-10-10 against the single-controller delivery flow. This lists
every tracked file, including this audit. Required means used by the current
supported setup; it does not mean you must run every helper to deploy locally.
No previous signed-delivery workflow or validation controller remains.

## Folders

| Folder | Role | When needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.github/` | Code ownership | Protecting reviewed CI changes; GitHub rules must enforce review |
| `vars/` | Jenkins shared-library entry points | Every service build and deployment PR |
| `pipelines/` | Seed, promotion, rollback, manifest check and verifier | Delivery; verifier needs target-host credentials |
| `jenkins/jobs/` | Job DSL | Creating/updating Jenkins jobs through the Pipeline seed |
| `jenkins/agents/` | Common inbound build-agent image | Building/rebuilding your agent; existing agents can continue running |
| `jenkins/controller/`, `jenkins/casc/` | Fresh controller image/configuration | New installations and reproducible configuration checks |
| `jenkins/scripts/` | Installation, diagnostics, tests and upgrade tools | Bootstrap, troubleshooting and maintenance |
| `docs/` | This audit | Understanding and reviewing repository scope |

The old separate root `scripts/` folder has been removed; plugin-lock maintenance
now lives alongside the other Jenkins tools. Local `.env`, plugin caches and
private migration state are ignored runtime files, not source folders to deploy.
Preserve existing Jenkins homes and private state during upgrades.

## Cleanup and deliberate choices

Removed `lockable-resources`: no remaining pipeline uses its lock step and no
retained plugin requires it. The remaining 79 plugins are eight direct features
and their required dependency closure: JCasC, Copy Artifact, GitHub Branch Source,
Job DSL, JUnit, Matrix Authorization, Timestamper and the standard Pipeline bundle.
Some dependency names do not appear in Groovy; deleting them would break plugins.
The Pipeline bundle includes milestone support as a required dependency.

Removed agent Go/Maven downloads and unused whole-tree extraction support.
Service Dockerfile test/build environments already supply those language tools.
Java 21 remains required for Remoting. Python runs orchestration scripts; PyYAML
reads configuration. Docker/buildx builds/runs containers; Helm/kubeconform check
manifests; Trivy/Syft scan and produce SBOMs; gh creates PRs/statuses. kubectl
supports verification. Terraform and AWS CLI support the optional AWS worker;
AWS CLI also authenticates AWS kubeconfigs. Separate workers still need separate
identities; sharing an image does not imply sharing credentials.

Both controller and agent Dockerfile-specific context filters are retained.
The two plugin manifests are complementary: JSON is the verified installation
contract; TXT is the readable version list. Existing manually installed Jenkins
must not be replaced with fresh JCasC merely to update a shared-library pin.

## Validation and limits

```bash
python3 jenkins/scripts/test-agent-tools.py
python3 jenkins/scripts/test-runtime-tools.py
python3 jenkins/scripts/doctor.py
python3 jenkins/scripts/smoke-controller.py --directory /tmp/boutique-ci-audit
```

The audit checks all Python/shell syntax, Markdown links, Compose structure,
Dockerfile definitions and the plugin dependency graph. Native Jenkins validates
all retained plugins, JCasC, actual Job DSL and Declarative pipelines; isolated
runtime fixtures check downstream failure propagation and JUnit pass/fail/unstable
gates. These fixtures use no real GitHub/cloud/cluster credentials.

A Dockerfile definition check is not a full image build. The revised agent image
must be rebuilt and scanned on the target host; its signed Debian snapshot must
be reachable. The existing connected agent remains usable because removing
unused tools changes no pipeline requirement. The controller image/new-install
path must be accepted on its target host before replacing an installation.
Live GitHub/GHCR publication, Argo deployment, target worker connectivity and
notifications remain separate acceptance work. See the platform repository's
[current validation](https://github.com/subhankar12-spec/boutique-platform/blob/main/docs/validation.md)
and [deployment guide](https://github.com/subhankar12-spec/boutique-platform/blob/main/docs/deploy-cicd-kind.md).
